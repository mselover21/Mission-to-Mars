# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to familiarize myself with HTML use in the development of web applications. Additionally I learned much about webscraping specific information from HTML to build a web app that specifically deals with information about Mars. Overall I enjoyed the challenge and learned a lot about how HTML is structured and written. I did struggle with adding bootstrap elements to the page however, the next week in Javascript seems to expand on this topic and I am excited to learn more about web development.
